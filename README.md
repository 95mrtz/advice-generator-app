## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [IT'S ALIVE!](https://manuelrtz.github.io/advice-generator-app/)

## My process

The process was faster than usual because it is a very small but very nice project.

The first thing was to build the structure in HTML and give it the design with CSS, declaring global variables with :root for the colors used.

Transform was also used to accommodate certain elements.

For the mobile version, the changes that had to be made were very small.

The operation using an external API, with fetch to fetch the data.

A very small project, but very entertaining.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- HTML DOM
- Fetch API
- [External API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)
